I started using the Tyntastic plugin for Vim, which will run a syntax checker on
the current buffer and then indicate any lines which have errors. I can open up
the list of errors as a location list using :Errors, and then jump to the
line of a given error newxx by hitting Enter, which will jump to the line containing
the error in my buffer.

A bad line so bad here.
I want to know how I can do the opposite. I want to go from a line in my buffer
that is marked with having a syntax error to the corresponding entry in the
location list, so that I can read the full error message in the list. How can I
do this? I know that :ll [n] will jump to the nth error in the list, but often I
will not know exactly which error number corresponds to the given line in the
buffer. I cannot find a command morexx that accepts a line number, rather than an error
number, however.

:SpellCheck
:caddexpr expand('%') . ':9:bad line'
:caddexpr expand('%') . ':14:42:corresponds'
:caddexpr expand('%') . ':4:29:indicate'
EOF
